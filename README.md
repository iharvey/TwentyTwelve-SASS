SASS ready, Compass.app compatible.

Default style.css is present simply to register as a child theme. Edit the Name/URL field to your liking. Not added to wp_head() output.

twentytwelvestyle.css for future reference and diff checking for parent theme changes.

SCSS file located in /sass/, compiled css file located in /stylesheets/ and enqueued already.

Feedback and pull requests always welcome. It'll make the SASS better.

So SASSy

You can find the style.scss in the /sass/ directory, and the generated file in /stylesheets/.

If you wish to have this file added to your <head></head> area again, remove all but "wp_enqueue_style( 'twentytwelve_sass', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/stylesheets/style.css' );" inside the enqueue_twentytwelve_sass() function in the child functions.php.
